## Getting Started

### For Alumni Research
1. Review the research methodology in `research/methodology/`
2. Set up data collection tools in `tools/data-collection/`
3. Begin with the alumni identification process
4. Follow the analysis workflow in `tools/analysis/`

### For Event Registration System (QR Codes & Barcodes)
1. Run the setup script: `python setup_registration_system.py`
2. This will install dependencies and test the system
3. Use the enhanced registration module: `python tools/data-collection/enhanced_registration_module.py`
4. The system will generate:
   - QR codes for registration forms and event information
   - Barcodes for participant tracking
   - PDF badges for participants
   - Comprehensive registration reports

## Research Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Alumni identification and initial data collection (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: Survey distribution and data gathering (3-4 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Data analysis and pattern identification (2-3 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Report generation and presentation (1-2 weeks)

## Event Registration Features
- **Google Forms Integration**: Automated form creation for event registration
- **QR Code Generation**: Multiple QR codes for different purposes (registration, event info, contact)
- **Barcode Generation**: Code128 and Code39 barcodes for participant tracking
- **PDF Badge Creation**: Professional participant badges with embedded codes
- **Bulk Processing**: Generate codes and badges for multiple participants
- **Data Export**: Export registration responses to CSV format
- **Automated Reporting**: Generate comprehensive registration reports
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for use in Africa with mobile devices
