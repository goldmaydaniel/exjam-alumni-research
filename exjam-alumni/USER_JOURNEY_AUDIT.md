## 🎯 CORE USER PERSONAS & JOURNEYS

### 👥 **1. PROSPECTIVE ALUMNI (Guest Users)**

**Goal**: Learn about EXJAM and register for events

**Journey Flow**:

**Pain Points in Current Structure**:

- 🚨 Multiple registration pages (/register, /signup, /create-account)
- 🚨 Unclear payment flow (/payment standalone)
- 🚨 No clear event registration integration

### 🎓 **2. ACTIVE ALUMNI (Authenticated Users)**

**Pain Points**:

- 🚨 Too many similar pages (multiple dashboard variants)

- 🚨 Badge system fragmented across routes

### 👑 **3. EVENT ORGANIZERS (Admin Users)**

**Goal**: Manage events, users, and system

**Pain Points**:

- 🚨 Some features may be over-engineered for current needs

## 🗑️ PAGES TO REMOVE/CONSOLIDATE

### **IMMEDIATE REMOVAL** (Duplicates/Unused)

```bash
🗑️ Remove These Pages:
├── /signup → Use /register instead
├── /create-account → Use /register instead
├── /api-login → Testing route, not needed
├── /admin-login → Use /admin with auth redirect
├── /test-alumni → Development testing only
├── /test-email → Development testing only
└── /setup-admin → One-time setup, not needed
```

### **CONSOLIDATION CANDIDATES**

```bash
🔄 Consolidate These:
├── /dashboard/enhanced-page.tsx → Merge into main dashboard
├── /dashboard/realtime-dashboard.tsx → Feature within dashboard
├── /dashboard/unified-page.tsx → Merge into main dashboard
├── /about/enhanced-page.tsx → Merge into main about
├── /events/page-backup.tsx → Remove backup
└── /events/simple-page.tsx → Merge or remove
```

### **FEATURE SCOPE REVIEW**

```bash
❓ Review These Features:
├── /connections (Alumni networking - is this MVP?)
├── /messages (Internal messaging - is this MVP?)
├── /admin/monitoring (System monitoring - overkill?)
├── /admin/reports (Reporting - can be part of analytics?)
└── /membership (Membership tiers - is this active?)
```

## 🎯 BUSINESS QUESTIONS FOR PRODUCT DECISION

### **🤔 FEATURE PRIORITY QUESTIONS:**

1. **Alumni Networking**: Do we need internal messaging and connections features for MVP?
2. **Membership Tiers**: Is the membership system with tiers active/needed?
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Do admins need complex monitoring, or is basic analytics sufficient?
