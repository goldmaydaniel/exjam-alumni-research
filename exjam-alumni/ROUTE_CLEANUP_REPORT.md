  "Contact",
  "Connections", // ❌ Alumni & Connections not public
];
```

### **Header Navigation (After)**

```javascript
[
  "Home",
  "About",
  "Events",
  "Contact", // ✅ Clear public navigation
];
```

**Changes Made**:

- ✅ Removed `/alumni` (should be authenticated feature)
- ✅ Removed `/connections` (networking feature, not core public nav)
- ✅ Focused on essential public pages for guest users

---

## 📱 CURRENT STREAMLINED STRUCTURE

/login (Authentication)
/register (Account Creation)
```

### **🔐 Authentication Routes (3 pages)**

```

/auth/callback (OAuth Callback)
```

## 🎯 USER JOURNEY IMPROVEMENTS

### **👥 Guest User Journey**

**BEFORE**: Confusing navigation with `/alumni` and `/connections` in public nav
**AFTER**: Clear path: `Home → About → Events → Register/Login`

### **🎓 Authenticated User Journey**

**BEFORE**: Multiple dashboard variants causing confusion
**AFTER**: Single dashboard entry point with clear navigation

### **👑 Admin User Journey**

**BEFORE**: Scattered admin interfaces and duplicate login pages
**AFTER**: Centralized admin access through single `/admin` route

---

## 🚀 NEXT PHASE RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Phase 2: Business Feature Review**

```
🤔 REVIEW THESE FEATURES:
├── /connections (Alumni networking - MVP priority?)
├── /messages (Internal messaging - MVP priority?)
├── /alumni/directory (Public vs authenticated feature?)
├── /membership (Membership tiers - active/needed?)
└── /admin/monitoring (System monitoring - overkill?)
```

### **Phase 3: Advanced Consolidation**

```
🔄 POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATIONS:
├── /admin/analytics + /admin/reports → Single analytics page
├── /admin/communications + messaging → Unified communication center
├── Payment flow integration → Embed in event registration
└── Badge system → Integrate deeper into user profile
```
