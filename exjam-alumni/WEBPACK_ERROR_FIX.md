# Webpack Error Fix Documentation

## Issue

The application was experiencing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')" errors from webpack during hydration, particularly affecting the Next.js Link component.

## Root Cause

The issue stems from webpack module resolution conflicts in Next.js 14.2+ when using certain configurations and component structures. The error occurs during client-side hydration when webpack fails to properly resolve module dependencies.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Primary Solution: Use Turbopack

Turbopack is Next.js's new bundler that replaces webpack and doesn't have these module resolution issues.

**Implementation:**

- Updated `package.json` to use Turbopack by default: `"dev": "next dev --turbo"`
- Turbopack provides faster compilation and eliminates the webpack errors

### 2. Fallback Solution: Custom SafeLink Component

Created a custom Link wrapper that uses Next.js navigation without relying on the problematic Link component import.

**Files created:**

- `/components/safe-next-link.tsx` - Router-based navigation component
- `/components/SafeLink.tsx` - Re-export for compatibility

### 3. Configuration Changes

- Simplified `next.config.js` to remove problematic webpack optimizations
- Disabled React Strict Mode temporarily to avoid double rendering issues
- Added transpilePackages for problematic dependencies

## How to Run

### With Turbopack (Recommended - No Errors)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### With Webpack (Legacy - May Have Errors)

```bash
npm run dev:webpack
```

## Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`
2. Open browser DevTools console
3. Navigate to different pages
4. Confirm no "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors appear

## Notes

- Turbopack is still in development but stable enough for development use
- For production builds, Next.js still uses webpack, but the build process handles modules differently and doesn't exhibit these errors
- The SafeLink component provides a fallback if Turbopack cannot be used
